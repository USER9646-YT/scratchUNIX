# scratchUNIX
UNIX-like operating system in Scratch/TurboWarp. Its a "monolithic kernel" using the rxFS filesystem on TurboWarp. you can actually change directories (cd) on this.

## Why?
I just like Scratch and OSes.

## WHAT TO DO

New Text engine uses IFrame and HTML, this means, a security warning will pop up in Turbowarp. Run without sandbox, and allow it to run, as its neccessary for this OS to function properly.
