# scratchUNIX
scratchUNIX, or S/UNIX is a UNIX-like operating system in Scratch/TurboWarp. Its a "monolithic kernel" using the rxFS filesystem on TurboWarp. you can actually change directories (cd) on this.

## Why and what is this?
This is a UNIX-like operating system running on Turbowarp, it uses rxFS, and many MORE UNIX commands. It has a semi-working service system, under the scr-proc application.

## WHAT TO DO
New Text engine uses IFrame and HTML, this means, a security warning will pop up in Turbowarp. Run without sandbox, and allow it to run, as its neccessary for this OS to function properly.

## OS style
This uses a modern looking desktop environment known as S/UNIX Desktop Environment. Its desktop environment is from a scrapped OS I made named NicoOS.
